Yes, I have already checked about that.
10:26 PM
c, c++, c# is my favorite language and your script looks very similar to them.
10:27 PM
C
we need to have a little library of well known algos that people recognize, so that they quickly can start up building their own variants
10:28 PM
Okay, no problem.
10:29 PM
C

10:29 PM
Yes, already. It looks a bit simple, but very useful.

10:40 PM
What do you mean?
10:40 PM
C
That you shold install and confirm to me that it works
10:40 PM
with you computer and so on - it is written in Qt and doesn't work everywhere
10:41 PM
Before start work, we have to dicuss our schedule.
10:41 PM
I don't understand you.
10:42 PM
If you build to exe from Qt, it will be executable anywhere.
10:42 PM

Not on W8 for example
10:42 PM
I'm an expert.
10:43 PM
We have to discuss our schedule before start work
10:43 PM
C
of course I will revert with a complete offer for you
10:43 PM
You should create the milestone before starting the work.
10:45 PM
C
yes, but I discuss it with you first
10:45 PM
Of course, I prefer to work hourly. Is it Okay for you?
10:46 PM
C
That's not what I envisaged but with many milestone maybe that works
10:46 PM
Good, so what do you think?
10:47 PM
How much are you going to pay for this project?
10:48 PM
C
100 per working algo on average, meaning 1000 for the first batch
10:48 PM
EUR
10:49 PM
How much do you want per hour?
10:49 PM
It depends on the difficulty of the project, usually arount 30USD.

10:52 PM

1. Download, install and get acquainted with QtTrader, Centrabit's native trading client. First the developer must submit his e-mail so he can be whitelisted in our database.
https://updates.centrabit.com/internal-testing/

Install demonstrate your first algo.

2. Translate four standard, well-known algos to our C-like script language. Documentation is enclosed which , outlining several time-saving functions that make the job easy. The algos are

a) Bollinger bands
b) MACD
c) RSI
d) Parabolic SAR

Delivery includes algos that work as they should - buy and sell, backtest, plot.

If this goes well, we are going to order at least 6 more algos for the sample algo library that needs to be built up to make it easier for new users to get started.
11:01 PM
First progress. QtTrader have been installed.
